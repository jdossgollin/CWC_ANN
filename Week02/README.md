# Week 02

Here's what we have so far:

  - `environment.yml`: you can install a custom conda environment (see resources in slack channel) that has all the packages we're using by running (in the terminal!) `conda env create --file environment.yml`. To activate it (and use those packages) run `source activate cwc_ann`. This has been tested on at least one computer (James) and worked great! Now you can type `source activate cwc_ann` when you're working on our projects here, and `source deactivate` to go back to your other packages when you're done.
- `XOR-numpy-network.ipynb`: from Peter Belhumeur's class (though adapted for python 3) this programs a hidden layer  neural network in python (`numpy`) -- no tensorflow. If you want to understand what this hidden layer is doing, this is worth going through. We won't go through it next Tuesday.

We'll add more stuff soon
