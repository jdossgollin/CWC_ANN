took a quick look
if I got the story right they consider GCM data and the temperature field predicted by the GCMs is considered as uncertain as modeled by enensemble of GCM runs -- then they consider various potential climate change predictors that were fed to the GCMs and their uncertainty and set up a model to choose how many EOF of the cov matrix are important, and use GLS + HB to solve

the problem itself does not interest me given the GCM issues of representation( I don't think they address that, since I did not quickly spot a discussion of real data performance)
However, their approach for dimension reduction may be  amore general problem and may be worth going back and understanding

Flag: read supplemental info for downscaling approach -- still uses EOFs but looks interesting }

- key point: the existence, or lack thereof, is probably not the key element of a decision analysis! People shouldn't be making assumptions based on whether there is a trend; they should be trying to make life better for people
- The decision tree is fine, but no reason this couldn't be done in a probabilistic framework (not really Bayesian b/c not learning any parameters)
- Their conclusion, that if we use NHST to determine whether we even consider a non-stationary model we get bad results, is a good one, but some of the underlying things they do are a little odd I think}

This is a really interesting step forward and I think that the SOMs are definitely an interesting tool to look at. At the same time, I don't quite buy the story of 6 days leading to flooding -- more or less might be more relevant, at least based on what I'm seeing

Also interesting is the fig. 11 -- looks like a lot of scaling arguments might make sense if you cluster by mechanism

If re-reading it's probably fine to skip to summary {\&} conclusions}
